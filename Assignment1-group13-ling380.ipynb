            "always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to\n",
            "give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this\n",

            "highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,\n",
            "intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years\n",
            "since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The\n",
            "vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to\n",
            "guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the\n",

            "had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy\n",
            "could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you\n",

            "created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding\n",
            "his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\n",

            "allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\n",
            "might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of\n",
            "one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and\n",
            "within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me\n",
            "that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should\n",
            "not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate\n",
            "pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\n",
            "benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I\n",
            "must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very\n",
            "insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be\n",
            "sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\n",
            "proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The\n",

            "receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\n",
            "between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\n",
            "to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he\n",
            "chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being\n",
            "now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and\n",
            "dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the\n",
            "decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,\n",
            "he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His\n",
            "circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,\n",
            "were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\n",
            "and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present\n",
            "him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little\n",
            "doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\n",

            "hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\n",
            "resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to\n",
            "the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in\n",
            "his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this\n",
            "period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I\n",
            "know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my\n",
            "notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\n",
            "myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me\n",
            "to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of\n",
